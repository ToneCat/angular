# About

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.3.

This is an Angular project that uses a service to fetch sample posts, and comments from a REST API source. The results are parsed into a table. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
